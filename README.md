# Emotion Detection Web App

An AI-powered Emotion Detection web app that identifies emotions from text, images, videos, and multilingual input. Built with Flask, DeepFace, HuggingFace Transformers, and Bootstrap, it features user authentication, real-time detection via AJAX, and a clean dashboard UI. With modular detection logic, clean code architecture, and robust unit testing, this all-in-one platform offers seamless emotion recognition across multiple media formats.

## 💡 Sample Use Cases

- Mental health and sentiment tracking  
- Content moderation  
- User feedback analysis  
- Emotion-aware AI applications  

---

## 🧠 Model Details

- **Text Detection**: NLP-based classification (e.g., Watson NLP or transformer-based models like `roberta-base-go_emotions`).
- **Image & Video Detection**: DeepFace for facial emotion recognition. Only one face per frame is processed for accuracy.

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- Live camera-based emotion detection  
- Voice emotion detection   
- Multi-face detection in group photos/videos  
- Mobile-responsive design improvements
